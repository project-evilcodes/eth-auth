# ðŸ™Œ Introduction

### Overview

**eth-auth** is a secure npm library for password-less user authentication on node.js decentralized applications (dApps) by signing an outwardly unpredictable dynamic JWT token with the user's Ethereum private key.

### Highlights

* Decentralised (Web3)
* Anonymous - User identity covered to dApp governors and the rest of the world.
* Password-less - Your Ethereum private key is your password, and it won't reveal to anyone.
* Breach-less - According to the eth-auth authentication architecture, no need to store meaningful user data in a database.
